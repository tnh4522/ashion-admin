# React + Vite Project

## Overview

This project is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). Vite is a fast, modern build tool that offers great development experience with hot-reloading, fast builds, and optimized production output.

## Features

- ⚡ **Vite** for fast development and build
- ⚛️ **React** for building user interfaces
- 🛠️ **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code linting and formatting
- 💅 **CSS Modules** or **Styled Components** (depending on project setup)
- 📦 **State Management**: Built-in with React hooks or third-party libraries like Redux (optional)
- 🧪 **Testing** (optional): Jest/React Testing Library

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   If you use npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   If you use yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**

   To start the development server with hot-reloading, run:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   or with yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**

   To build the project for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   or with yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

   The production build will be generated in the `dist` folder.

5. **Preview the production build**

   After building the project, you can preview it using:

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

   or with yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn preview
   ```

## Scripts

The following scripts are available in the project:

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the project for production.
- `npm run preview`: Preview the production build.
- `npm run lint`: Lint the code with ESLint.
- `npm run format`: Format the code with Prettier.

## Development Workflow

1. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
2. Edit files in the `src` directory. Vite will automatically reload the browser when changes are saved.
3. Lint and format your code using `npm run lint` and `npm run format`.
4. Build the app for production with `npm run build`.
